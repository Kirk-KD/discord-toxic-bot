# Toxic xD
*Development started on Mar 11, 2021.*

This bot is still under development.

Ever wanted a (kinda) toxic bot for your server? You have found the one.
This bot has a built-in currency game, moderation & infractions system, gif & video search, and much more other fun stuff.
Commands are beautifully embedded, and new commands are constantly added!
I'm not sure when this bot will be published, but keep an eye out!
